BARRY: To understand what I'm about to tell you, you need to do something first.  
You need to believe in the impossible. Can you do that? Good. You see that red blur? That's me. That too. There i am again.
My name is Barry Allen.
I am the fastest man alive.

My story is pretty simple. My whole life , I've been running. usually from bullies. sometimes I escaped. sometimes I did not.

NORA: Tell me waht happened.  
Those guys where picking on kids... ...just beacuse(cuz) they thought they weren't cool. It wasn't right.

```
pick on
to harass or bother someone or something, usually unfairly.
