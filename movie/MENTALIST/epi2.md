Oh. Boy, ami i glad to see you guys. We are sorely ill-prepared for this kind of deal. Quail hunter's dog found her this morning at 5:30. 
Wasn't meant to  be huntin' quail, but he was.

Lisbon:
----
Do we know who she is? 

MEN:(local police)
----
Nope. Looks familiar, though, so i'm guessing local.  People sure look different when they're dead, though, don't they?

Cho:
----
That wound doesn't look fatal.

Lisbon:
----
There's no ligature marks on the neck, so she wasn't strangled or hung. Gums are livid. Eyes are hemorrhaged.

Cho:
----
Suffocation. 

MEN:(local police)
----
My bet is it's a meth head form the city comin' in off the interstate. 

Jane:
----
No, he's a local. And it was an accident. Her killer didn't intend her to die this way. 

Lisbon:
----
How so?

Jane:
----
She still has her clothes on. Her abductor was taking her to a location that was quiet and private so he could undress her for a sexual assault. She made too much noise at the wrong moment. He tried to keep her quiet and smothered her by mistake. No good to him now, so then he dumps her in a spot only a local would know.

Lisbon:
----
She's all yours. thanks for waiting. 

Cho:
----
Why sexual motive? could be gangs or drugs. 

Jane:
----
A drug trade smothering? By who -- "sesame street" crips?

Lisbon:
----
There's nothing to say it isn't just boyfriend trouble. 

Jane:
----
Could be boyfriend trouble. doesn't feel like it, though.

MEN:(local police)
----
Who is this guy? 

Lisbon:
----
He's a consultant.
